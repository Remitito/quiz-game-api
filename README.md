**Inquizitive**

This is the back end of the my quiz game, which was made as an alternative to sites like Bamboozle which were unaccessible in the school I was working at due to regional internet restrictions.

**How to run**

To run it locally: 1) Clone the repo 2) Enter 'npm install' in the terminal 3) Enter 'npm start' in the terminal 4) Send requests to http://localhost:3000/

**Live Version**

The live version of the full-stack app can be found at: https://inquizitive-l7wp.onrender.com

**Tech Stack**

The back end uses Node with Express for handling requests, with Mongoose used for interactions with MongoDB where the quizzes are stored
