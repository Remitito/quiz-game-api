**Inquizitive**

This is the back end of the my quiz game, which was made as an alternative to sites like Bamboozle which were unaccessible in the school I was working at due to regional internet restrictions.

**Live Version**

The live version of the full-stack app can be found at: https://inquizitive-l7wp.onrender.com

**Client / front end**

Inquizitive's front end repo can be found here: https://github.com/Remitito/quiz-game-client


**Tech Stack**

The back end uses Node with Express for handling requests, with Mongoose used for interactions with MongoDB where the quizzes are stored
